# predicting_alcohol_content

Our model is to predict the alcohol content in a wine.
Wine Quality Dataset

package: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn,
func:
Data: Wine Quality Data Set (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality/) 2 datasets are included, related to red and white "vinho verde wine" samples, from the north of Portugal. Each wine sample comes with a quality rating from 1 to 10, and results from several physical chemical test. There are 11 columns describing chemical properties as follows. If we were the owner of a vineyard, how might we use it?

Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):

1 - fixed acidity
2 - volatile acidity
3 - citric acid
4 - residual sugar
5 - chlorides
6 - free sulfur dioxide
7 - total sulfur dioxide
8 - density
9 - pH
10 - sulphates
11 - alcohol
Output variable (based on sensory data):

12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)
